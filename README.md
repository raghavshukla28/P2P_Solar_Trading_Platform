- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity with OpenZeppelin security standards
- **State Management**: Provider pattern for efficient state handling
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive UI for various device sizes

## Architecture
The platform consists of three main components:

1. **Smart Contracts (Ethereum)**
   - Energy trading contract
   - User management
   - Transaction handling
   - Security implementations

2. **Mobile Application (Flutter)**
   - User interface
   - Wallet integration
   - Real-time trading
   - Analytics visualization

3. **Analytics Backend (Python)**
   - Market analysis
   - Price tracking
   - Usage patterns
   - Prediction models
